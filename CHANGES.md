_2.0.3_

 * `material.build()` is now `.link()` to be consistent. The old name will continue to work.
 * `.pipe()` and `.require()` now accept a `defines` argument, a hash of symbols to `#define` ad-hoc in GLSL.
 * `.visualize(graph)` now shows the original code snippets in popups
 * Added `.inspect(graph)` which shows a floating inspector panel
